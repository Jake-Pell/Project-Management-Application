Meeting Notes 10/25/2023

- In replies: take out chunk in for loop and do comment.add(getCommentJSON(r));
- Work on DataLoader (2 people)
- convert UUID into User object (get user by ID)
- Move columns using index for multiple moves at once instead of one at a time
- In UI, break down into scenarios as methods to make testing easier (comment out other scenarios while testing, no user interaction required yet)
- Eventually will need to check username, password requirements, etc.
- Get done 2 days early to have more time for testing
